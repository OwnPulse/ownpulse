# CLAUDE.md — OwnPulse

This is the root conventions file. Read it before making any changes. Then read the `AGENTS.md` in the specific directory you're working in.

---

## Project Philosophy

1. **Data sovereignty** — nothing leaves the user's instance without explicit opt-in
2. **No lock-in** — full export, always, in open formats
3. **Open schema** — versioned, public, documented
4. **Non-judgmental** — all interventions are legitimate data; never validate, filter, or warn on substance names anywhere in the stack
5. **Manual entry is first-class** — every data type supports manual entry; wearables are optional
6. **Bidirectional sync** — data written here writes back to HealthKit where a mapping exists; not a silo
7. **Federation-ready** — hooks in place, implementation deferred
8. **Tests are not optional** — every function has a unit test, every endpoint has an integration test, every flow has an E2E test; CI enforces this

## Working With AI Agents

This repo is designed for parallel AI agent work (Claude Code, Cursor). Read this section before starting any task.

### Orientation

1. Read this file (done)
2. Read `AGENTS.md` in the root — it maps the full codebase and tells you which agent owns what
3. Read the `AGENTS.md` in the specific directory you're working in
4. Run the test suite for your area before making changes — establish a baseline

### Git worktrees

**Always use a git worktree for feature work.** Never commit directly on `main` or work in the primary checkout.

```bash
# Create a worktree for your feature branch
git worktree add ../ownpulse-feat-name -b feat/feature-name

# Work in the worktree
cd ../ownpulse-feat-name
# ... make changes, commit, push ...

# Clean up when done
cd ../ownpulse
git worktree remove ../ownpulse-feat-name
```

Why: worktrees prevent agents from stepping on each other's work. Each agent gets an isolated copy of the repo with its own working tree and index. The primary checkout stays clean on `main` for reference.

Rules:
- One worktree per feature branch
- Name the worktree directory after the branch: `../ownpulse-feat-name`
- Always branch from latest `main` (`git pull` first)
- Push the branch and open a PR from the worktree
- Remove the worktree after the PR is merged
- Never leave uncommitted changes in a worktree you're not actively using

### Agent boundaries

Each service is independently buildable and testable. Work within one service at a time.

| Directory | Single command to test |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `backend/` | `cargo test` |
| `web/` | `npm test` |
| `ios/` | `xcodebuild test -scheme OwnPulse` + `maestro test ios/maestro/flows/` |

### Interface boundaries

The services communicate via the REST API. The interface is defined by:
- `docs/api.md` — authoritative API documentation
- `pact/contracts/ios-backend.json` — iOS consumer contract
- `pact/contracts/web-backend.json` — web consumer contract

When you change an API endpoint, check if it's covered by a contract and update it. Run `cargo test --test contract` to verify.

### Opening PRs

- Open a draft PR as soon as you start significant work
- Push regularly — CI runs on every push, giving you feedback
- Don't merge your own PRs — humans review and merge
- One concern per PR — don't bundle unrelated changes

### What NOT to do as an agent

- Don't modify files outside your assigned service without flagging it
- Don't disable or skip tests to make CI pass — fix the underlying problem
- Don't add `#[allow(dead_code)]` or `// eslint-disable` to silence warnings — fix them
- Don't hit real external APIs in tests — use WireMock fixtures
- Don't assume a running database in tests — use testcontainers

---

## Architecture

Three services, one API. k3d on dev machines, k3s on servers — same Helm charts, same kubectl, different install method:

```
web/        React + Vite + unovis    →  app.<domain>   (nginx container)
backend/    Rust + Axum              →  api.<domain>   (Rust binary container)
ios/        Swift + SwiftUI          →  iOS device/simulator
```

All three consume the same REST API with JWT auth. The web and iOS share the same auth flow and token format.

## Backend Conventions (Rust)

### Toolchain and style

- Rust stable, edition 2021
- Axum 0.7, Tokio full runtime, SQLx 0.7
- `sqlx::query_as!` macros throughout — compile-time query checking
- `thiserror` for library error types, `anyhow` acceptable in binary entry points only
- `tracing` for all logging — no `println!`; JSON in production, pretty in dev
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` — no warnings on `main`; CI enforces this

### Module structure

```
auth/           JWT issue/verify, refresh token logic, middleware extractor
routes/         One file per route group; each file is a function returning a Router
models/         Serde structs for request/response; separate from DB types
db/             SQLx query functions; no business logic
jobs/           Tokio background tasks; one file per integration sync job
integrations/   HTTP clients for external APIs; WireMock-compatible
export/         Streaming export logic; never buffers full dataset
stats.rs        Pearson correlation, lag correlation, rolling averages
crypto.rs       AES-256-GCM; all token encrypt/decrypt goes through here
```

### Testing (backend)

**Unit tests** — in `tests/unit/` or as `#[cfg(test)]` modules:
- No database, no network
- Pure functions: stats math, crypto operations, data transformations, route handlers with mocked DB
- `cargo test --lib`

**Integration tests** — in `tests/integration/`:
- `testcontainers-rs` — every test module calls `common::setup_db()` which spins up an ephemeral Postgres container
- External APIs mocked with `wiremock` — fixtures in `tests/fixtures/<source>/`
- Tests are fully parallel-safe — no shared state
- `cargo test --test integration`

**Contract tests** — in `tests/contract/`:
- `pact_verifier` reads `pact/contracts/*.json`
- Spins up the API against a testcontainers Postgres
- `cargo test --test contract`

**Test data generation:**
- Use `fake` crate for realistic test data
- Use `rstest` for parameterized tests
- Never hardcode UUIDs or timestamps in tests

### HealthKit write-back (unconditional rule)

Records with `source = 'healthkit'` are **never** inserted into `healthkit_write_queue`. This check happens in the service layer, not the route handler. It is not configurable. It cannot be bypassed by any API parameter.

### Deduplication

Before inserting any `health_record`, query for existing records within 60 seconds and 2% value tolerance from a different source. If found: log a structured warning with both record IDs and sources, apply `source_preferences` for this metric type, insert the record with a `duplicate_of` reference (add this nullable column). Never silently drop.

---

## Schema Conventions

- Postgres 16
- All migrations in `db/migrations/`, numbered: `0001_init.sql`
- **Never edit existing migrations** — add new ones
- All PKs: `UUID`, `gen_random_uuid()`
- All timestamps: `TIMESTAMPTZ`
- Schema changes require updating `schema/open-schema.json` and `docs/data-model.md`
- Run `cargo sqlx prepare` after any schema or query change; commit `.sqlx/`

### Key tables

| Table | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `users` | structured | Accounts |
| `health_records` | structured | All wearable/device measurements |
| `interventions` | structured | Substances, meds, supplements — no name validation |
| `daily_checkins` | structured | Five 1-10 subjective scores |
| `lab_results` | structured | Blood panel data |
| `calendar_days` | structured | Meeting aggregates |
| `genetic_records` | structured | SNP variants, stored verbatim |
| `observations` | **flexible** | All user-defined: events, scales, symptoms, notes, context tags, environmental |
| `source_preferences` | structured | Per-metric source-of-truth preference |
| `healthkit_write_queue` | structured | Pending HealthKit write-backs |
| `integration_tokens` | structured | OAuth tokens for all integrations (AES-256-GCM encrypted) |
| `refresh_tokens` | structured | JWT refresh tokens |
| `sharing_consents` | structured | Cooperative data sharing consent |
| `export_jobs` | structured | Export audit log |

### `observations` table

The extensibility layer. `type` is one of: `event_instant`, `event_duration`, `scale`, `symptom`, `note`, `context_tag`, `environmental`. `value` is JSONB — validated by `type` in the API layer, not at DB level. **Do not add new structured tables for new user-defined data types** — add a new `type` value to `observations` instead.

`value` JSONB by type:
```
event_instant:     {} or {"notes": "15 min at 90°C"}
event_duration:    {} or {"notes": "..."}
scale:             {"numeric": 6, "max": 10}
symptom:           {"severity": 4}
note:              {"text": "..."}
context_tag:       {}
environmental:     {"numeric": 22.5, "unit": "celsius"}
```

### Cooperative data boundary

`sharing_consents` is the trust boundary. **Never** aggregate another user's data without checking for active consent. Genetic data requires a separate consent record with `dataset = 'genetics'` — this is independent from and stricter than health data consent. Consent revocation takes effect immediately — no grace period.

---

## Testing Conventions

### The rule

Every PR must maintain or improve coverage. CI fails if:
- Any test fails
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` has warnings
- `cargo sqlx prepare --check` is stale
- `tsc --noEmit` has errors
- Playwright E2E fails

### Backend

```bash
cargo test --lib                   # unit tests
cargo test --test integration      # integration (testcontainers)
cargo test --test contract         # pact verification
cargo test                         # all of the above
```

### Web

```bash
npm test                           # vitest (unit + component)
npm run test:e2e                   # playwright
npm run type-check                 # tsc --noEmit
```

### iOS

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -scheme OwnPulse \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'

maestro test ios/maestro/flows/    # E2E flows
```

### WireMock fixtures

External API responses are recorded once and committed to `backend/tests/fixtures/<source>/`. Structure:

```
tests/fixtures/
├── garmin/
│   ├── activities-list.json
│   └── hrv-summary.json
├── oura/
│   ├── readiness.json
│   └── sleep.json
└── dexcom/
    └── egvs.json
```

WireMock stubs are set up in `tests/common/mock_servers.rs`. Never modify fixtures to make a test pass — if the API response format changes, update the fixture and the parsing logic together.

### Pact contracts

Consumer contracts live in `pact/contracts/`. When adding or changing an endpoint:
1. Check if the endpoint is referenced in any contract file
2. If yes: update the contract, run `cargo test --test contract` to verify backend still satisfies it
3. If adding a new endpoint used by iOS or web: add it to the appropriate consumer contract

---

## Web Frontend Conventions

- React 18, TypeScript strict mode, Vite
- **Charts: unovis only** (`@unovis/ts` + `@unovis/react`) — do not use recharts, Chart.js, or D3 directly
- State: Zustand for client state, TanStack Query for server state + caching
- API calls: typed wrappers in `web/src/api/` — never raw fetch in components
- Auth: JWT in memory + httpOnly cookie for refresh token — **never localStorage**
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for unit test API mocking
- Playwright for E2E — tests run against real backend via testcontainers (Postgres) + backend process in CI

---

## iOS Conventions

- Swift 6, SwiftUI, iOS 18 minimum
- **No third-party dependencies except GRDB** (offline queue) and Swift Testing
- Charts: **Swift Charts** (native, Phase 3b+) — no third-party charting library
- Unit tests: **Swift Testing** framework (Xcode 16) — not XCTest
- UI tests: **XCUITest** for complex flows, **Maestro** for E2E
- SwiftUI testing: **ViewInspector** for testing views without simulator
- HealthKit abstracted behind `HealthKitProvider` protocol — `MockHealthKitProvider` in tests
- Network abstracted behind `NetworkClient` protocol — mock in tests
- JWT in **Keychain** only — never `UserDefaults`
- Offline queue: GRDB SQLite — failed syncs retry on next foreground/background refresh
- Accessibility identifiers on all interactive elements — XCUITest uses these, never text matching
- Phase 1: no charts — "Open Dashboard" button opens `app.<domain>` in Safari
- Phase 3b: Swift Charts for dashboard — hero metric, sparklines, today card, weekly summary

### Maestro flows

Flows live in `ios/maestro/flows/`. File names match the user story: `log-intervention.yaml`, `complete-checkin.yaml`, `connect-garmin.yaml`. Flows must be deterministic — use `assertVisible` to confirm state before acting.

---

## CI/CD

### Runner strategy

**Linux jobs** (backend, web): ARC (Actions Runner Controller) — ephemeral runner pods in k3s cluster on the droplet, autoscale to zero, label `arc-runner-set`.

**macOS/iOS jobs**: Self-hosted Mac mini M4 + Tart VMs. Each job gets a fresh ephemeral macOS VM with Xcode 16 pinned. Label `macos-tart`. No GitHub-hosted macOS runners — they are slow, flaky, and expensive. See `docs/infrastructure.md` for full Mac mini setup runbook.

**Connectivity**: Tailscale connects Mac mini, droplet, and dev machines. No public ports on the Mac mini.

```
backend.yml    unit + integration + contract + clippy + sqlx check + build   runs-on: arc-runner-set
web.yml        vitest + playwright + tsc + build                             runs-on: arc-runner-set
ios.yml        swift testing + xcuitest + maestro (inside Tart VM)          runs-on: macos-tart
deploy.yml     helm upgrade when backend + web pass on main                  runs-on: arc-runner-set
```

All jobs idempotent. No shared runner state. iOS failures do not block deploy — pragmatic for solo dev, tighten when team grows.

## What Not To Do

- **Don't validate substance names.** The platform is non-judgmental by design.
- **Don't write healthkit-sourced records back to HealthKit.** The cycle guard is unconditional.
- **Don't silently drop duplicate records.** Log the conflict, apply source_preferences, preserve provenance.
- **Don't add new structured tables for user-defined data types.** Add a new `type` to `observations`.
- **Don't buffer export responses.** Stream everything.
- **Don't skip or disable tests.** Fix the underlying problem.
- **Don't hit real external APIs in tests.** Use WireMock fixtures.
- **Don't aggregate another user's data without checking sharing_consents.**
- **Don't include genetic data in cooperative aggregates without `dataset = 'genetics'` consent.**
- **Don't interpret genetic records.** Store verbatim; annotation is Phase 4.
- **Don't implement federation.** Leave `federation_id` and `source_instance` nullable with no logic.
- **Don't add analytics or telemetry.**
- **Don't store JWT in iOS UserDefaults or web localStorage.**
- **Don't use recharts, Chart.js, or raw D3 in the web frontend.** Use unovis.
- **Don't use third-party charting libraries in the iOS app.** Use Swift Charts.

## Local Setup

**k3d vs k3s:** k3d runs k3s inside Docker on your dev machine. k3s runs directly on Linux servers (droplet, self-hosted VPS). Same Helm charts, same kubectl commands — only the install method differs. Use k3d locally, k3s in production.

### Option A: k3d (full local cluster — matches production exactly)

```bash
# Create local cluster
k3d cluster create ownpulse-local --port "8080:80@loadbalancer"

# Deploy all services via Helm (same as production)
helm upgrade --install postgres helm/postgres -n ownpulse --create-namespace
helm upgrade --install api helm/api -n ownpulse
helm upgrade --install web helm/web -n ownpulse

# Run migrations
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:dev@localhost:5432/ownpulse
cd db && sqlx migrate run
```

### Option B: services only (faster iteration)

```bash
# Postgres only via Docker (no full cluster)
docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev -p 5432:5432 --name pg postgres:16
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:dev@localhost:5432/ownpulse
cd db && sqlx migrate run
cd backend && cargo sqlx prepare --workspace
cargo run -p api         # API on :8080

# Web
cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # Web on :5173

# iOS
open ios/OwnPulse.xcodeproj           # Point to http://localhost:8080
```

Option B is faster for day-to-day backend and web development. Use Option A when testing Helm chart changes, ingress config, or anything infrastructure-related.

### Running tests

```bash
# Backend (testcontainers handles Postgres — no running DB needed)
cargo test

# Web
cd web && npm test && npm run test:e2e

# iOS
xcodebuild test -scheme OwnPulse \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
maestro test ios/maestro/flows/
```

### Developer API credentials

Register early — some have approval delays:
- **Garmin Connect API** — developer.garmin.com — human review, can take 1-2 weeks
- **Oura API** — cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens — personal token, instant
- **Dexcom Developer** — developer.dexcom.com — approval required, a few days
- **Google Cloud Console** — instant
